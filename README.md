This module contains algorithms that can be deployed on an Autonomous RC car.

It can be integrated using a Raspberry Pi and a PiCam. To reduce the overhead on the Pi, yoou can run a server and client module where all the training and testing is done on the client and all the server(Pi) does is to collect and transfer the data.
